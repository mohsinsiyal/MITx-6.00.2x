Exercise 1
3/3 points (graded)
1. Would placing the drunk's starting location not at the origin change the distances returned?

No
correct
If so, what line would you modify to compensate? Enter the line number (eg 17). If not, just type None.

1. def simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass):
2.     homer = UsualDrunk()
3.     notOrigin = Location(1, 0)
4.     distances = []
5.     for t in range(numTrials):
6.         f = Field()
7.         f.addDrunk(homer, notOrigin)
8.         distances.append(round(walk(f, homer, numSteps), 1))
9.     return distances
None
  correct  
2. If you were going to use random.seed in a real-life simulation instead of just when you are debugging a simulation, would you want to seed it with 0?

No
  correct
