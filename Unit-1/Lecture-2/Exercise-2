4/4 points (graded)
Dynamic programming can be used to solve optimization problems where the size of the space of possible solutions is exponentially large.

True
correct
Dynamic programming can be used to find an approximate solution to an optimization problem, but cannot be used to find a solution that is guaranteed to be optimal.

False
correct
Recall that sorting a list of integers can take  O(nlogn)  using an algorithm like merge sort. Dynamic programming can be used to reduce the order of algorithmic complexity of sorting a list of integers to something below  nlogn , where n is the length of the list to be sorted.

False
correct
Problem: I need to go up a flight of  N  stairs. I can either go up 1 or 2 steps every time. How many different ways are there for me to traverse these steps? For example:
3 steps -> could be 1,1,1 or 1,2 or 2,1
4 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1 or 1,1,2 or 1,2,1 or 2,1,1 or 2,2
5 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1,1 or 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,2,1 or 1,2,1,1 or 2,1,1,1 or 2,2,1 or 1,2,2 or 2,1,2
Does this problem have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems?


It has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
